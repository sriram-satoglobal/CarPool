# Welcome to Pay-A-Way Carpooling Application

This is an application for car pooling service with social networking integration.

Provide the convenience and flexibility of car pool: passengers can select drivers who are starting at a nearby location with a routine that will pass by the destination for the passengers. People will have the option to make friends after trips by mutual interests. This added a social media feature for the business.

With the social media feature added, the business can be expanded by interesting more users. The roles between passengers and drivers are fully interchangeable. This concept is introduced to making it feasible for the social media feature, from a psychological view point.

The idea is basically to build a carpool application around the concept of social commuting where consumers have option to choose who shares the ride based on common routes and personal point of interest. We can use google maps or Waze API's to plot routes as well as drop off locations using an app for android and IOS users. 

Since the application can be embedded with social media like Facebook and google chat, it can make coordination and sharing more efficient. Some of the benefits of common ride could be access to HOV lanes during the rush hours, meeting new array of individuals with common interest, sharing rides with friends and family members, convenient and faster service saving money in gas and reduce air pollution.
